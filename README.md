# awwan

awwan is configuration management software, infrastructure as file and
directory layout.

In other words, `awwan` is a command-line interface to shell script, that
can execute multiple lines of commands in local or remote server using shell
or SSH.

Do you have a collection of shell scripts to manage one more similar server?
Do you ever want to execute only part of your script?
Are you get tired with learning others syntax and tools for provisioning
your own server, while you need is a handful knowledge of shell script?

If yes, awwan is the right tools for you.

Features,

* Encryption. Awwan can read and copy encrypted files.
* Encrypted variables. Awwan can read and executed script that contains
  encrypted variables.
* Dynamic script with variables. An awwan script is like shell script but
  can be executed in different remote servers with different values.
* Dynamic script execution. Unlike shell script, awwan can select which
  lines to be executed, either by number or by range.
* Provisioning in local environment using basic shell.
* Provisioning in remote server using SSH and SFTP.
