== To-do

* [ ] `#-put:` and `#-put!`, put file as is without parsing.

* [ ] Add option to set file owner and attributes in #put command,
+
--
Example,

	#put!user:group+0600 <src> <dest>

The first option is user, and then separated by ":" is group and then
separated by "+" is attributes.
--

* [ ] replace "play" with "remote". This is breaking changes.

* [ ] use "play" to run script that contains "#local:" and "#remote:".

* [ ] wui: Cleanup stdout and stderr on run.

* [ ] wui: Refresh the tree

* [ ] Cache the script, fstat the script before reading.
+
--
This is quite complex because if the script contains call to `{{.Val ...}}`,
we need also to check if the awwan.env or .awwan.env.vault also changes.
--

* [ ] Cache the environment file

* [ ] Export each of variable as system environment variable with format:
  `SECTION_SUBSECTION_KEY`
