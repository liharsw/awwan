Now that we know about environment variables and encryption, both of them
can be combined into storing encrypted environment variables into file
".awwan.env.vault".

The ".awwan.env.vault" is created from file ".awwan.env" that then
encrypted.

In this workspace, we provide an example of ".awwan.env.vault".
Lets get one of the value on it,

  echo {{.Val "user:awwan:pass"}}

If we run it, it will print the value of "user:awwan:pass",
